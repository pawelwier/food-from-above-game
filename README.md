# food-from-above-game
## Start
npm install && npm run start

## Rules
1. Choose your options and click START (the more difficult, the faster the food falls but each caught item gives you more points)
2. Catch the food items before they hit the floor
3. With every wasted food item you lose 1 HP 
4. With every 3 items caught you reach new level
5. New level means 1 HP retrieved (not more than your initial HP number)
6. New level also means food speed increases and item interval decreases

GOOD LUCK!
